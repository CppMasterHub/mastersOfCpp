        C++ (pronounced "see plus plus") is a powerful and versatile programming language that builds upon the foundation of the C programming language. It was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup in the late 1970s and is widely used for various applications, including system software, game development, high-performance applications, embedded systems, and more. C++ combines the features of C with object-oriented programming (OOP) principles, making it a popular choice for developers seeking both low-level control and high-level abstractions.

        <h2 class="it-heading">Key Features of C++:</h2>
        <ol class="it-list">
            <li>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): C++ supports the principles of OOP, allowing developers to organize code into classes and objects, promoting code reusability and modularity.</li>
            <li>Strong Type System: C++ enforces strict type checking, helping catch type-related errors during compilation and ensuring safer and more predictable code behavior.</li>
            <li>Performance: C++ provides low-level memory manipulation capabilities, allowing developers to optimize code for maximum performance in resource-intensive applications.</li>
            <li>Standard Template Library (STL): The STL offers a collection of pre-built classes and functions, simplifying common programming tasks and enhancing code efficiency.</li>
            <li>Portability: C++ code can be compiled and executed on various platforms and operating systems, enabling cross-platform development and deployment.</li>
            <li>Memory Management: C++ gives developers control over memory management through features like manual memory allocation and deallocation, offering flexibility in resource usage.</li>
            <li>Multiple Paradigms: In addition to OOP, C++ supports procedural and generic programming paradigms, allowing developers to choose the most suitable approach for their projects.</li>
            <li>Community and Ecosystem: C++ has a large and active community of developers, extensive libraries, and frameworks, fostering collaboration and providing solutions to various challenges.</li>

    <div class="getting-started">
        <h2 class="it-heading">Getting Started with C++:</h2>
        <p class="it-content">To begin programming in C++, you need a compiler (such as GCC, Clang, or Microsoft Visual C++) and a text editor or integrated development environment (IDE) like Visual Studio, Code::Blocks, or CLion. You'll write C++ code in source files with the ".cpp" extension.</p>

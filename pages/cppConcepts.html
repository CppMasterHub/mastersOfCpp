    <p class="it-content">C++ is an Objected Oriented Programming language. Initially named 'c with classes'.C++ was developed by<tr><td></td> Bjarne Stroustrupat AT&T Bell laboratories Murray Hill, New Jersey and Simula and SmallTalk. C++ is also called as extensionof C.In 1983 the name was changed to 'C++'form 'C with classes' because of increment Operator ++ of C.</p>

        <ol class="it-list">
            <li>It is a versatile language for hanling very large programs.</li>
            <li>C++ add enormous capability to C.</li>
            <li>C++ retains and improves organization capabilities of C.</li>
            <li>"C" part of c++ gives ability to get close to the machine language.</li>
            <li>Provides support for object-oriented design and Programming.</li>
            <li>it is suitable for the development of editors, compilers, database, communication ystems and any real life application system.</li>
            <li>Provides improvements for certain C constructs, and for input/output.</li>
            <li>C++ allows creating hierachy related objects so one can build special object orientd libraries which can be used later.</li>
            <li>C++ programs are easily maintainable and expandable. when a new feature needs to be added, it is a veryeasy to add to the existing structure. </li>

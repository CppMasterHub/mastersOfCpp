        <p class="it-content">
            <strong>C++</strong> (pronounced "see plus plus") is a powerful and versatile programming language that builds upon the foundation of the C programming language. It was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup in the late 1970s and is widely used for various applications, including system software, game development, high-performance applications, embedded systems, and more. C++ combines the features of C with object-oriented programming (OOP) principles, making it a popular choice for developers seeking both low-level control and high-level abstractions.

            <h2 class="it-heading">Getting Started with C++:</h2>
            <p class="it-content">To begin programming in C++, you need a compiler (such as GCC, Clang, or Microsoft Visual C++) and a text editor or integrated development environment (IDE) like Visual Studio, Code::Blocks, or CLion. You'll write C++ code in source files with the ".cpp" extension.</p>
